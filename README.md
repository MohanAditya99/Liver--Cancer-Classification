# Liver--Cancer-Classification
This is a neural network project to classify liver disease using the "Indian Liver Patient Dataset," which includes clinical features like age, gender, and enzyme levels. The model is trained on preprocessed and encoded data, achieving moderate accuracy and demonstrating the potential of deep learning for early liver disease diagnosis.
